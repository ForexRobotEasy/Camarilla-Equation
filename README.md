## Trading Modes

The code defines two trading modes: Conservative and Aggressive.

## Trading Levels

The code defines key trading levels: L3, L4, H3, and H4.

## Expert Initialization Function

The `OnInit` function initializes the expert advisor. It sets the trading mode, trading instrument, stop-loss level, take-profit level, and lot size. It then calculates the key trading levels using the `CalculateLevel` function. 

If the trading mode is set to Conservative, it places a buy order at the L4 level and a sell order at the H4 level. If the trading mode is set to Aggressive, it places a buy order at the L3 level and a sell order at the H3 level.

## Expert Tick Function

The `OnTick` function is called on every tick and performs necessary operations.

## Calculate Trading Level Function

The `CalculateLevel` function calculates the trading level using the Camarilla Equation algorithm. The result is returned.

## Place Order Function

The `PlaceOrder` function executes a trading order based on the specified parameters.

## Expert Deinitialization Function

The `OnDeinit` function is called before deinitialization and performs necessary actions.
